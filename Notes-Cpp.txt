**** vector size compared with negative values ****

	- vector.size() ==> returns size_t (which is an unsigned integer).
	- when you compare an integer and an unsigned integer, the integer gets casted to an unsigned int, which may result in the wrong value when comparing negative integers.

	Observe the following:
	std::vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

	bool test1 = -1 < nums.size(); // evaluates to false, because -1 gets converted to an unsigned integer (really large). 
	bool test2 = nums.size() > -1; // also evaluates to false, same reason
	bool test3 = -1 < (int)nums.size(); // evalutates to true, since we will now be performing a signed integer comparison
